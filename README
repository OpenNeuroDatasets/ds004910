An open relaxation-diffusion MRI dataset in neurosurgical studies

The MRI data was collected from 18 patients (including glioma, meningioma, diffuse large B-cell, multiple sclerosis, cortical cerebral infarction, and brain abscess) and two healthy individuals (11 females and 9 males; age range: 28.0 - 70.0 years; median age: 51.0 years; IQR: 21.5 years). The rdMRI data is acquired on a 3T Philips MRI scanner with 7 TEs (two healthy individuals has only 5 TEs, sub-05 and sub-15). All participants provided written informed consent before participation and signed informed consent regarding publishing their data. The Research Ethics Committee, Faculty of Medicine in Union Hospital, Tongji Medical College, Huazhong University of Science and Technology, China approved the study protocols.
